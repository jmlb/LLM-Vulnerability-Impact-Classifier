# LLM-Vulnerability-Impact-Classifier
a pipeline for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) on smart contract data, focusing on multitask learning to classify security vulnerabilities and predict their impact. The project aims to enhance smart contract auditing by leveraging LLMs to automatically detect multiple vulnerabilities and assess their severity.
